WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/home/njs82@drexel.edu/ECEC472/NCSU_FreePDK45/runs/mixer.calibre.db' already exists. It will be overwritten.
INFO (XSTRM-288): The automatic layer mapping is done by StreamOut and the xStrmOut_layerMap.txt file is generated. This is because either the layer mapping is not provided or the XST_AUTO_LM value is used with the -layerMap option.
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the objectMap option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the objectMap option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream. For details on the objectMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
